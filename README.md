# The Tunnel

The Tunnel is a 3D first person shooter in a underground tunnel where the goal of the player is to collect a certain amount of spheres. This short game was the final assignment in my game developement course. In The Tunnel I was mostly concentrating on:

* Making the 3D model of the game world completely inside Unity
* How to make lively and complicated lighting
* Creating particle systems (explosions, muzzle blasts, smoke etc.)
* Visual post processing
* Getting a object break on interaction
* Creating a functional pause menu
* Creating a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience
